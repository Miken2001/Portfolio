# 🧱 Vulnerability Assessment – Public Database Exposure

## 🎯 Objective  
This activity focused on assessing a critical vulnerability affecting an e-commerce company: a **remote database server** left open to the public for over three years. As the cybersecurity analyst, I was tasked with performing a **vulnerability assessment**, outlining potential threats, and creating a remediation plan to secure sensitive data.

## 🪜 Steps

### 📌 Step 1: Understand the Context  
- Company used a remote database to support remote teams  
- The database had been publicly accessible since launch  
- No IP restrictions, encryption, or authentication layers were configured

---

### 📌 Step 2: Identify Vulnerabilities  
- Open port exposure (e.g., 3306 for MySQL)  
- No encryption for data in transit  
- Default database credentials  
- Lack of role-based access control (RBAC)

---

### 📌 Step 3: Assess Potential Risks  
- 🛑 Unauthorized access to customer and product data  
- 💸 Risk of data exfiltration, service disruption, or ransomware attacks  
- ⚖️ Regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) and reputational damage

---

### 📌 Step 4: Recommend Remediation  
- Restrict database access to internal IPs or VPN-only  
- Require strong authentication and remove default credentials  
- Enable encryption (TLS) for all connections  
- Implement RBAC and regular access audits  
- Monitor access logs and alert on abnormal activity

---

✅ **Outcome:** Delivered a vulnerability assessment outlining the risks of an exposed remote database. Proposed a comprehensive remediation plan to secure data, comply with regulations, and align with security best practices.
