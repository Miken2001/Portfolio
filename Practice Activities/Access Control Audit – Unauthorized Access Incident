# 🔐 Access Control Audit – Unauthorized Access Incident

## 🎯 Objective  
This activity involved investigating a security incident in which a payment was initiated to an unauthorized bank account. As the newly hired cybersecurity professional, I reviewed system access logs, identified weaknesses in access control, and recommended specific mitigations to prevent future unauthorized actions.

The scenario emphasized the importance of authentication, authorization, and access logging in maintaining a secure system.

- Analyzed user activity logs for suspicious behavior  
- Identified gaps in access control implementation  
- Applied principles of least privilege and separation of duties  
- Recommended actionable access control mitigations  
- Practiced incident triage from a business-focused security lens

## 🪜 Steps

### 📌 Step 1: Log Analysis  
- Investigated access logs to identify users with permissions to authorize payments  
- Traced the timeline of when the unauthorized transaction was initiated  
- Detected an account with elevated privileges that should not have had financial access

---

### 📌 Step 2: Identify Threat Actor  
- User was authenticated successfully (not an external compromise)  
- Activity indicated internal misuse or a misconfigured role  
- Highlighted need for stricter role-based access controls (RBAC)

---

### 📌 Step 3: Pinpoint Access Control Issues  
- Lack of **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**  
- Excessive privileges granted to non-finance team members  
- Missing audit trail for role or permission changes

---

### 📌 Step 4: Recommend Mitigations  
- Implement **MFA** for all users with access to financial or sensitive systems  
- Enforce **role-based access controls** (RBAC) with least privilege principle  
- Schedule **regular access reviews** and auto-expiration of elevated roles  
- Enable detailed **logging and alerting** for all payment-related actions

---

✅ **Outcome:** Completed a post-incident access control audit. Discovered security gaps in role assignment and authentication enforcement. Delivered clear technical and procedural mitigations to improve organizational access control and prevent misuse.
