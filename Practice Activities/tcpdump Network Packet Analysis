# 📡 tcpdump Network Packet Analysis – DNS Failure

## 🎯 Objective  
This hands-on activity simulated a network outage affecting access to a company website. Using **tcpdump**, I analyzed packet data to determine the root cause of the connectivity issue. The goal was to investigate the **“Destination port unreachable”** error and confirm whether DNS resolution was failing due to a misconfigured or unavailable service.

---

## 🧠 Skills Learned  
- Used tcpdump to capture and analyze live network traffic  
- Identified protocol-specific issues (UDP, DNS, ICMP)  
- Traced errors related to unreachable services (e.g., port 53 for DNS)  
- Practiced root cause analysis based on packet behavior  
- Strengthened understanding of IP addressing and protocol flow

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- 🧪 **tcpdump** – to capture raw packet data and inspect network requests  
- 🌐 **Browser** – to simulate traffic to the failing website  
- 📄 **Log inspection** – to interpret timestamps, source/destination IPs, and protocol-level errors

## 🪜 Steps

### 📌 Step 1: Simulate the Issue  
- Attempted to visit `www.yummyrecipesforme.com`  
- Received `Destination port unreachable` error in the browser  
- Confirmed that DNS resolution was likely failing

---

### 📌 Step 2: Run tcpdump  
- Captured packets during the site access attempt  
- Observed outgoing **UDP** requests to port `53` (DNS standard port)  
- Logged incoming **ICMP** responses indicating:  
  `udp port 53 unreachable` from DNS server

---

### 📌 Step 3: Analyze Logs  
- Timestamps confirmed packet flow  
- Source IP: my device (`192.51.100.15`)  
- Destination IP: DNS server (`203.0.113.2.domain`)  
- ICMP error message showed DNS port was not responding

---

### 📌 Step 4: Conclude Root Cause  
- DNS server was not listening or not available on port 53  
- Application-layer services were fine, but network-layer name resolution failed  
- Concluded that the DNS outage prevented users from reaching the website

---

✅ **Outcome:** Successfully used packet-level analysis to diagnose a network-layer service failure. Demonstrated ability to interpret protocol behavior, trace failed connections, and identify infrastructure misconfigurations in a real-world scenario.
