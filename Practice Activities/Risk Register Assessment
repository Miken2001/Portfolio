# 📋 Risk Register Assessment

## 🎯 Objective
The **Risk Register Assessment** activity focused on identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing security risks that could impact a company’s operations. The goal was to determine the **likelihood** and **severity** of various cyber threats, calculate an overall **risk score**, and learn how to prioritize mitigation efforts accordingly.

This exercise helped build foundational knowledge of risk management — a core competency for cybersecurity professionals.

## 🧠 Skills Learned
- Developed a working understanding of risk assessment methodology
- Practiced assigning likelihood and impact/severity scores to threats
- Learned to calculate risk scores and rank threats by priority
- Gained experience in analyzing and documenting security risks
- Applied critical thinking to improve organizational risk posture

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- 📊 **Spreadsheet tools** (Google Sheets / Excel) for building a risk register
- 🧮 **Scoring rubric** to assess risk (scale of 1–5 for both likelihood and severity)
- 📚 **NIST CSF** framework as a reference to contextualize threats and categories

## 🪜 Steps

### 📌 Step 1: Create the Risk Register Table
Define the columns as follows:
- `Threat`
- `Likelihood (1–5)`
- `Severity (1–5)`
- `Risk Score` (`Likelihood x Severity`)
- `Mitigation Plan`

---

### 📌 Step 2: Identify and Document Threats
Examples of threats analyzed:
- Phishing email campaigns  
- Unpatched software vulnerabilities  
- Weak or reused passwords  
- Insider threats  
- Misconfigured firewall settings  

---

### 📌 Step 3: Score and Prioritize
Each threat was scored by likelihood and severity. Example:

| Threat                    | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Score |
|---------------------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Phishing Email Campaign   | 5          | 4        | 20         |
| Unpatched Software        | 4          | 4        | 16         |
| Weak Passwords            | 3          | 3        | 9          |
| Insider Threat            | 2          | 5        | 10         |
| Misconfigured Firewall    | 3          | 4        | 12         |

---

### 📌 Step 4: Plan for Mitigation
Focus resources on high-risk items first. For example:
- **Phishing**: Deploy awareness training, implement email filters  
- **Unpatched Software**: Introduce automated patch management  
- **Weak Passwords**: Enforce stronger password policies and MFA
