# 🧭 SIEM Log Analysis & Threat Detection

## 🎯 Objective  
This activity focused on simulating real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows using a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system. The goal was to detect and investigate suspicious activity within logs, understand how alerts are generated, and practice decision-making as a security analyst.

The scenario included alerts triggered by login anomalies, file changes, or unauthorized network activity — requiring structured incident response thinking.

## 🧠 Skills Learned  
- Developed practical understanding of SIEM functionality  
- Analyzed event logs to trace suspicious user behavior  
- Interpreted alerts and mapped them to security incidents  
- Identified security events vs false positives  
- Practiced incident response logic aligned with playbook phases

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- 🔎 Simulated SIEM dashboard (Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, or Elastic stack logic)  
- 📈 Log files: Authentication events, network activity, endpoint alerts  
- 🗂️ Incident response playbooks  
- 📚 MITRE ATT&CK mappings (theoretical, not directly used)

## 🪜 Steps

### 📌 Step 1: Understand the Alert  
- Received alert: "Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login"  
- Context: Unusual time of access, geolocation inconsistency

---

### 📌 Step 2: Log Analysis  
- Reviewed log entries for:
  - Username and IP used
  - Time of access
  - Source geolocation and device type
- Correlated login times and endpoints to verify if behavior matched normal patterns

---

### 📌 Step 3: Incident Investigation  
- Identified sequence:
  1. Repeated login failures  
  2. One successful login from unusual location  
  3. Privilege escalation attempt or file access after login

---

### 📌 Step 4: Incident Response  
Mapped actions to IR playbook phases:
- **Detection:** SIEM alert triggered by login pattern anomaly  
- **Analysis:** Verified risk through cross-log inspection  
- **Containment:** Flagged account, triggered access review  
- **Recovery:** Recommended forced password reset, endpoint scanning  
- **Lessons Learned:** Suggested alert tuning and geo-based access control

---

✅ **Outcome:** Completed end-to-end detection workflow using simulated SIEM data. Strengthened understanding of how SOC analysts investigate threats, correlate log events, and respond with structured procedures.
