# 🌐 DDoS Incident Report – ICMP Flood Attack

## 🎯 Objective  
This project simulated a real-world DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack targeting a multimedia company. The network was overwhelmed with ICMP traffic, disrupting internal connectivity and shutting down services. As a security analyst, I documented the event and used the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to create a strategic plan for detection, response, and prevention.

## 🧠 Skills Learned  
- Identified and analyzed a DDoS attack using protocol-based behavior (ICMP flood)  
- Applied the five NIST CSF functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover  
- Created a layered response plan including firewall rules and traffic filtering  
- Improved understanding of network behavior and anomaly detection  
- Practiced recovery planning and business continuity preparation

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Incident Report Template  
- NIST CSF as a security strategy framework  
- Simulated firewall & IDS/IPS rules to defend against ICMP attacks  
- Log data analysis to identify traffic patterns and spoofed IPs

## 🪜 Steps

### 📌 Step 1: Identify  
- Discovered network services were unresponsive  
- Analyzed logs and packet data, confirmed a spike in inbound ICMP packets  
- Found the source to be a misconfigured firewall allowing flood traffic

### 📌 Step 2: Protect  
- Implemented a **rate-limiting rule** on incoming ICMP packets  
- Activated **source IP verification** to block spoofed addresses  
- Ensured only trusted IP ranges could communicate with internal services

### 📌 Step 3: Detect  
- Deployed **network monitoring tools** to detect abnormal traffic spikes  
- Added alerts for rapid ICMP traffic patterns  
- Enabled **IDS/IPS rules** to flag suspicious protocol behavior

### 📌 Step 4: Respond  
- Temporarily shut down non-essential services  
- Blocked the malicious IP ranges at the perimeter firewall  
- Collaborated with the network team to restore essential functions

### 📌 Step 5: Recover  
- Documented the event for post-incident review  
- Hardened firewall configurations and updated incident response playbook  
- Scheduled simulations to improve future response times

✅ **Outcome:** Successfully mitigated the simulated DDoS attack, applied structured incident handling using the NIST CSF, and developed layered defenses to reduce future risk.
