# 🛡️ Welcome, I'm Mikenson⚡

Hey there — I’m just a **curious guy from Haiti** who’s into **technology, challenges**, and constantly **pushing limits**. Whether I’m breaking down a network packet or piecing together a phishing email, I live for the moments where problem-solving meets adrenaline.

Right now, I’m deep in the trenches of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, leveling up from foundations to real-world defense. This repo is my digital lab — part progress tracker, part playground, and 100% hustle.

If you are a fan of learning by doing, or you just like seeing someone grind their way into the infosec world — welcome. 💻🧠🔥
